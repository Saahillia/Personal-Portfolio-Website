My core strength lies in backend development using Java and SQL. A project I'm particularly proud of is the University Management System, where I was responsible for the backend logic and database design. I implemented features like role-based access control to ensure data integrity and built tools for effective data management. I've also applied my Java skills to create practical academic tools like a CGPA calculator.<br>
                On the frontend, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've designed and developed fully responsive websites, including this portfolio and a to-do list application, with a focus on creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.<br>
                As a problem solver and a collaborative team player, I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited to apply my skills to deliver innovative and impactful software solutions
