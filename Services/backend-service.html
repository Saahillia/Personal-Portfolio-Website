            <h4>My Backend Philosophy</h4>
            <p>A strong backend is the backbone of any successful application. I focus on writing robust, secure, and efficient server-side code using Java, ensuring that the application logic is solid and data is handled with integrity.</p>
            <h4>Key Areas of Expertise</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Language (Java):</strong> Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build scalable and maintainable application logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Security & Authentication:</strong> Implementing features like role-based access control to ensure users only access data appropriate for their permission level.</li>
                <li><strong>GUI Development:</strong> Experience with Java Swing to create user-friendly desktop interfaces that connect seamlessly with the backend logic.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Project Spotlight</h4>
            <p><strong>University Management System:</strong> My flagship backend project, built in Java, manages all university operations with three distinct user roles (Administrator, Faculty, Student). The backend enforces strict access control and handles all core logic.</p>
            <p><strong>CGPA Calculator:</strong> This command-line tool, built in Java, showcases my ability to solve practical problems with clean, efficient code and logical processing.</p>
