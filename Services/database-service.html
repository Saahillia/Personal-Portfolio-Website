            <h4>My Database Philosophy</h4>
            <p>Data is the most valuable asset of an application. I design and manage SQL databases with a focus on efficiency, integrity, and scalability, ensuring that data is well-organized, secure, and can be retrieved quickly.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Areas of Expertise</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Language (SQL):</strong> Writing proficient queries to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Design (Schema):</strong> Designing logical schemas with well-defined tables, columns, and relationships using primary and foreign keys.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Organizing and structuring information to support application features, such as generating dynamic reports or populating user-specific dashboards.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Project Spotlight</h4>
            <p><strong>University Management System:</strong> The core of this application is its robust SQL database. I designed the schema from the ground up with tables for students, faculty, courses, and grades. The application uses complex SQL queries to generate academic reports and manage course enrollments.</p>
