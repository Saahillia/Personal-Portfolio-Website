            <h4>My Frontend Philosophy</h4>
            <p>I believe the frontend is more than just code; it's the digital face of an application. My approach focuses on creating intuitive, responsive, and performant user experiences that are both visually engaging and accessible to all users.</p>

            <h4>Key Areas of Expertise</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Web Technologies:</strong> Writing clean, semantic HTML5; advanced styling with CSS3 Flexbox and Grid; and building interactivity with JavaScript (ES6+).</li>
                <li><strong>UI/UX & Design:</strong> Translating Figma concepts into functional code with precision and a focus on user-friendly navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Utilizing browser storage (like Local Storage) to save user data and maintain application state, providing a seamless experience across sessions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Project Spotlight</h4>
            <p><strong>This Portfolio Website:</strong> This site serves as a practical example, built from scratch with pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It features scroll-reveal animations via the Intersection Observer API and a filterable gallery using the MixItUp.js library.</p>
            <p><strong>Lakshya To-Do App:</strong> In this project, I focused on core JavaScript principles to build a fully functional to-do list. All data is saved to the browser's Local Storage, demonstrating my ability to manage client-side data persistence.</p>
